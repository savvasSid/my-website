    <h2>My Journey In Sports</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the sports corner of my personal website! Throughout my athletic career, I've had the privilege of participating in various sports, each contributing to my growth and character.
    </p>
    <p>
        I dedicated the biggest part of my sports career to football, 
        which lasted 15 years with many successes and failures in equal measure. 
        I had several prospects to enter this sport, although I did not manage to play professionally. 
        Competing in A local for 4 years and in C category for 1 year. 
        After that, I had been involved in kick boxing for a few months but I didn't like it very much as it was too much for me and I left it relatively quickly.
        Finally, as my student life began I stopped football due to lack of time and started working with the gymnasium where I still work today. 
        I also participate in a student soccer team where we compete in a student tournament, as well as many other sports activities related to female students, such as hiking, hiking, etc.
